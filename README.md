# lets-make-prototype

Playable Version: https://henryhoare.itch.io/lets-make-prototype

This project uses Unity version 2019.2.9f1 

This prototype was designed to be part of the Convergence Design Lab Civic Imagination Toolkit, currently consisting of
https://convergencedesignlab.org/web-resources/passion-to-purpose/ .

The focus of this tool is to help the user choose a medium and desired impact/goal for a project. For example: "Let's make posters to raise awareness". The design of this prototype had an emphasis on the physicality of virtual interaction that Passion to Purpose did contain. This is where the idea of decks of cards came from. Where passion to purpose was a mad libs experience of writing in your passions and purposes to form a 'How Might We' question, I wanted Let's make to function as a mix & match style of mad libs. With mediums, you can argue that there are infinite possibilites, but a thoughtfully curated list of mediums broken into categories, or decks, allows to provide resources and explanations for each medium.

The core of the user experience is choosing medium cards from one or multiple decks, and pairing them with impact cards to find the most exciting combination to pursue. 

Missing from this prototype is card content for decks other than the visual art deck, smoother transitions between 'pages', a lot of flair and visual design, and the much needed inclusion of actual resources and iamges to be provided on the final page. These resources would be the user's call to action at the end of the experience, providing them with next steps for their project.
